    <h1>The complete eDiscovery certification overview!</h1>
    <div class='intro'>
      <p>Certificates are a popular means of improving your resume in the world of e-Discovery. When looking on LinkedIn, you will notice that many eDiscovery professionals certify in at least one specialty. Whether it's a vendor-agnostic course like ACED's eDiscovery specialist, or the challenging Relativity Certified Administrator, you will certainly enjoy the advantages of getting certified!</p>
      <p>We've scoured the web for every single certificate which is currently available in eDiscovery and have created an overview with what we consider the most essential aspects of every certificate exam or course:</p>
      <ul><li>Pricing</li><li>Course/Exam Setup</li><li>Course/Exam Duration</li><li>Whether it's online or a test center location</li><li>Any mandatory training or courses</li><li>Any recommended prerequisites</li><li>If there are any CLE credits to be obtained</li><li>How to maintain the certificate,</li><li>The retake policy (if any)</li></ul>
      <p>You will notice that it's quite hard to compare the certificates with one another. For example, some certificates might require a 3-day course, while others will allow you to take the exam without any mandatory prerequisites. The pricing is also wildly different, ranging from tens to thousands of dollars.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this page is, therefore, not to compare certificates one-on-one but for you to get a full overview of what's out there for the eDiscovery tools that you use on a daily basis, and your amount of experience in the industry.</p>

      <h2>Independent eDiscovery certification programs</h2>
        <p>We kick off the overview with two institutes that offer certification, which is not tied to a specific vendor or software, but seek to improve your general eDiscovery skill-set: ACEDS and Arkfeld's EDEC.</p>
        <hr class="solid">
        <h3>Association of certified E-Discovery Specialists (ACEDS) Certification</h3>
        <p>ACEDS (A BARBRI Professional Association) is a member organization for e-discovery professionals. The organization is vendor-neutral and has no commercial or financial ties. The membership for eDiscovery professionals includes, among other perks, a mentorship program and live webinars.</p>
        <p>The ACEDS Certified E-Discovery Specialist exam is one of the most popular certificates in E-Discovery. For good reasons, as nearly 40 experts have collaborated to construct one of the most challenging exams in eDiscovery! In may 2021, a Canadian version has launched in Beta.</p>
        <p>Since 2018, ACEDS offers a new certificate designed for e-Discovery professionals at all levels: The eDiscovery Executive Certificate.</p>
        <p>In 2021, ACEDS together with the National Society of Legal Technology introduced a new training and certificate called the “eDiscovery Technology Certificate” (eDTech). This new training program provides law students and legal professionals with an interactive exploration of e-Discovery technology solutions</p>
